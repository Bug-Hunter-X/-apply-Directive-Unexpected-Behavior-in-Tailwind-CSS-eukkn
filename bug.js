```javascript
// Example using Tailwind's @apply directive
<div class="@apply bg-gray-200 p-4">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

This code might unexpectedly not apply the styles if the `@apply` directive is used incorrectly or in a context where it's not supported.  The `@apply` directive should be used within a class definition to avoid issues.
