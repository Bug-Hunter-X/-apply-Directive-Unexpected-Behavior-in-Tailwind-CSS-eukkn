# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the `@apply` directive in Tailwind CSS.  The `@apply` directive is powerful but can lead to unexpected behavior if misused.  This example showcases a scenario where styles fail to apply due to incorrect usage.

## Bug Description

The `@apply` directive, when used incorrectly or in an unsupported context, can fail to apply the expected styles. This commonly happens when it's not applied directly within a class definition or if there are conflicts with other CSS rules. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that `@apply` is used correctly within class definitions and that there are no conflicting CSS rules that might override the `@apply` styles. For details, see `bugSolution.js`.
